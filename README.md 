# CAPTCHA Project

A simple text-based CAPTCHA system built with PHP and tested using OCR-based attacks.

## Technologies
- PHP (with GD library)
- Python (EasyOCR)
- MySQL (optional)
- MAMP Server (macOS)

## How to Run the CAPTCHA System
1. Place the project folder in `htdocs` inside MAMP.
2. Start MAMP and go to `http://localhost:8888/captcha-project/index.php`.

## OCR-Based CAPTCHA Breaking
The `break_captcha.py` script uses EasyOCR to test how secure the CAPTCHA system is.  
Screenshots and logs are in the `/ocr_results` folder.
